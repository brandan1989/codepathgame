## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
Youtube

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
The most challenging thing I have encountered was adding the gif to the read.me and making the sound play during the game. I read though all my code and searched online to see if I could find a solution. I do have dyslexia and a slow processing disorder so it's possible I could have over looked it. I am very interested in getting help to see if I could add it to my read.me and add the sound to my game.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
One thing that has always been on my mind about web development is all the frameworks and libaraies. I don't understand why there is so many and if they all have benedits, I want to know what those benefits are.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours, I would add a few more features. I would add the ability to have more than one player play, have a score board to keep each players score, and set a how many times the game can be played. I would also add more animations, like for the sqaures to jump around when the mouse hovers over it, and when one of the players win, it would be a firework show and big text saying winner.
